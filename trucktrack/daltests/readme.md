Basic Docs for Testing
======================


Running the tests
-----------------

To run the tests, go to the terminal and set your directory to one of the test projects: daltests or uitests. At the terminal, type 

```shell
/daltests% dotnet test
```

You should see output about the results of the tests. Generally, green is good, and red is bad. The last line summarizes the test results with how many tested failed and how many tests passed.
